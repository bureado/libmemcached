Note from bureado:

memccp is a very useful tool, but it strips the leading / on the filenames.
It also doesn't allow to specify a key. That makes memccp hard to use in a
companionship scenario such as with nginx (for massively adding stuff to a
memcached and use it from nginx)

This patch adds --key to memccp and also leaves the leading / so you can
use it in a scenario such as:

#!/bin/sh

BASE="/var/www/mysite"

for file in `\
  find $BASE -type f \
    -name '*.jpg' -or \
    -name '*.gif' -or \
    -name '*.css' -or \
    -name '*.png' \
  | sed "s#$BASE##"`
do
  echo "Adding $file to memcached..."
  sudo memccp --key=$file --servers=localhost $BASE$file
done

Enjoy!

Hi!

So what is this? It is a library in C for connecting to memcached servers
(http://danga.com/memcached/). It is also a collection of utilities designed
to work with memcached.

memcat - Copy the value of a key to standard output
memflush - Flush the contents of your servers.
memrm - Remove a key(s) from the server.
memstat - Dump the stats of your servers to standard output
memslap - Load generation utility (benchmark!)

The library is in production in many locations (upwards to 1000+ nodes).

The project has information here: http://libmemcached.org/

Documentation can be found here: http://docs.libmemcached.org/

Want to contribute? If you write more then three good patches, then I will
just ask you to commit directly to the tree. I am happy to have additional
people work on this project. Please checkout README.FIRST. 

You will need a C99 compiler in order to compile this library. Currently we
actively support Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, and Solaris. A Windows port is
currently not supported, but one is listed on the homepage that is supported
by someone in the community.
